## Installation

```
pip install git+https://github.com/sytseng/ndx-harvey-swac.git
```

## Usage

There are two extnesion to the `LabMetaData` type. The `LabMetaDataSession` is for reading metadata in the NWB files for individual imaging sessions. Load the class before reading the NWB file:
```python
from ndx_harvey_swac import LabMetaDataSession
```
The `LabMetaDataSession` contains information about the task parameters (`TaskParam`), AAVretro injection sites (`AAVretroInjSite`), imaging setup (`Imaging`) and FOV registration (`Registration`).



The other type of extension, the `LabMetaDataMouse`, is for reading metadata in the NWB files for individual mice that contain the widefield retinotopy and vessel image of the cranial window under two photon microscope. Load the class before reading the NWB file:
```python
from ndx_harvey_swac import LabMetaDataMouse
```
The `LabMetaDataSession` contains information about the registration parameters (`Registration`) for aligning widefield data and two-photon cranial window vessel image to Allen Mouse Common Coordinate Framework (CCF).
